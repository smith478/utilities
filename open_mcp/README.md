## Open MCP

The idea here is to play around with MCP using open source models, most likely with ollama. There are a few tools to help with this:
- [oterm](https://github.com/ggozad/oterm)
- [ollama-mcp-bridge](https://github.com/patruff/ollama-mcp-bridge)
- [open-webui](https://docs.openwebui.com/openapi-servers/mcp/)
