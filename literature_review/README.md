The idea here is to perform literature review using something like [PaperQA2](https://github.com/tevang/paper-qa2). For this we need to see if there is a set of foundational texts or pdfs that cover the topic in depth.

## Setup

```bash
pip install paper-qa
cd to/papers/dir
pqa ask 'When is the best time for puppy socialization?'
```
