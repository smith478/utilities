## Chess Tutor

The idea here is to use LLMs to generate explanations for chess moves and then use this information to create a tutor that can explain the best move at any given time.

This will rely on stockfish to generate recommended moves. You will need to first install stockfish [here](https://stockfishchess.org/download/). On a mac this can be done with homebrew with `brew install stockfish`.
